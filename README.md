With this repository we hope to provide free teaching material to 
learn Computational Economics. Each lecture is self-containg and
is supplemented with the corresponding code. When possible we provide
code that can be used with software that is freely available on the 
internet, like Octave, Maxima, Libreoffice etc., lowering the threshold 
for using the lectures.
